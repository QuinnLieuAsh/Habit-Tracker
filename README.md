# My Personal Project - Habit Tracker

## Gamify your life 

This project will be a habit tracker that will allow users to set goals, input their activities and monitor their progress in acheiving those goals. The hope for this project is that it will make creating habits a charming and rewarding process. Rather then tracking just tracking the days a habit has been completed, the app will have features of video games to track progress. 

*These features include:* 
- An **XP bar** to track overall progress
- Small **XP boosts** each time a habit is completed
- **Level-Ups** once goals are met and the bar is filled 

Upon setting goals, you will be required to set small milestones in between your end goal and your beginning. This will allow for lots of little level ups along the way to make a rewarding and encouraging experience for the user. 

This app could be used by people of all ages, but will most likely be attractive to people who are current or past gamers, as the app will have a retro video game theme. It is intended for people who would like to better themselves by creating good habits, learn new skills or implement disipline into their life.

This project is of interest to me because I have struggles to keep a consistent routine throughout my life. There have been times where I have tried to learn a new skill or do well in school, but I was not consistent with my approach to acheiving these goals which introduced a lot of stress and decreased my preformance. I have always wanted to try habit trackers but I encountered a pay wall too many times. I think this will be a great way to approach reaching my goals with a light hearted and fun flair to it.
